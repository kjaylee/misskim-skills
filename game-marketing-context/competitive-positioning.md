# 🎯 Competitive Positioning Frameworks

Frameworks for positioning eastsea.monster games against competitors.

## Framework 1: Category Design

### Step 1 — Define the Category

Don't compete in an existing category. Create a micro-category you can own.

```
❌ "We're a puzzle game" (competing against 500,000 puzzle games)
✅ "We're instant-play Telegram puzzle games" (own the niche)
```

### Category Naming Formula

```
[Adjective] + [Platform/Channel] + [Genre] + [Games/Experiences]

Examples:
- "Instant-play Telegram mini games"
- "Zero-download browser arcade games"  
- "One-tap casual puzzles for chat"
```

### Our Category

> **Instant-play social mini games** — games you play in one tap, right where you chat.

## Framework 2: Competitive Landscape Map

### How to Map Competitors

Plot competitors on two axes relevant to your differentiation:

```
                    High Polish
                        │
         AAA Mobile     │    Premium Indie
         (Supercell)    │    (Steam hits)
                        │
  Low ──────────────────┼────────────────── High
  Friction              │              Friction
                        │
      ★ eastsea.monster │    Traditional Mobile
      (instant play)    │    (app store games)
                        │
                   Low Polish
```

**Our quadrant:** Low Friction + Good Polish = unique position

### Template: Competitive Analysis per Game

```markdown
## {Game Name} — Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (same mechanic + platform)
| Game | Platform | MAU | Strength | Weakness |
|------|----------|-----|----------|----------|
| {comp 1} | | | | |
| {comp 2} | | | | |

### Indirect Competitors (same audience, different solution)
| Game/Activity | Why they compete | Our advantage |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| {e.g., TikTok} | Same "kill time" job | We're interactive |
| {e.g., Candy Crush} | Same casual puzzle need | We're zero-install |

### Substitutes (non-game alternatives)
| Activity | Why it competes | How we win |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Social media scrolling | Same micro-moment | More satisfying |
| Reading articles | Same waiting time | More fun |
```

## Framework 3: JTBD Four Forces (Applied)

For each game, analyze the four forces that determine whether a player switches:

### Force Analysis Template

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                SWITCHING TO US               │
│                                              │
│  PUSH (from current)    PULL (toward us)     │
│  "Current game is..."   "This game has..."   │
│  • {frustration 1}      • {attraction 1}     │
│  • {frustration 2}      • {attraction 2}     │
│  • {frustration 3}      • {attraction 3}     │
│                                              │
│─────────────────────────────────────────────│
│                                              │
│  HABIT (stay put)       ANXIETY (fear)       │
│  "But I already..."     "What if..."         │
│  • {inertia 1}          • {worry 1}          │
│  • {inertia 2}          • {worry 2}          │
│  • {inertia 3}          • {worry 3}          │
│                                              │
│              STAYING WITH CURRENT             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Common Forces for Our Portfolio

#### Universal PUSH Factors (What drives players away from alternatives)
- "App store games are too big (500MB+ for a puzzle?)"
- "I'm tired of games that need internet + account + permissions"
- "Mobile games feel like ad machines, not games"
- "Same gameplay recycled with different skins"
- "Pay-to-win killed the fun"

#### Universal PULL Factors (What draws them to us)
- "One tap and I'm playing — insanely fast"
- "No download, no account, no permissions"
- "Actually fun, not just a Skinner box"
- "Fresh indie games, not corporate clones"
- "Play right in Telegram without switching apps"

#### Universal HABIT Factors (What keeps them elsewhere)
- "I've been playing Candy Crush for years, my progress..."
- "My friends play other games"
- "I already have games on my phone"
- "I know how mobile games work"

#### Universal ANXIETY Factors (What scares them about trying)
- "Browser games look cheap / are they safe?"
- "Will it work on my phone?"
- "Is it going to crash or lag?"
- "Will my data be safe in a Telegram game?"

### Counter-Messaging per Force

| Force | Counter-Strategy | Message Example |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Reduce **Habit** | "Complement, don't replace" | "Play between your other games — it takes 2 minutes" |
| Reduce **Anxiety** | "Zero risk trial" | "No download, no account, no data. Just tap and play." |
| Amplify **Push** | "Name the frustration" | "Tired of games that take 500MB to install? Same." |
| Amplify **Pull** | "Demo the magic" | Show 3-second GIF: tap → playing → fun moment |

## Framework 4: Positioning Statement Generator

### Formula

```
For [target persona]
who [situation/need],
[Game Name] is a [micro-category]
that [key benefit].
Unlike [main alternative],
[Game Name] [key differentiator].
```

### Portfolio Example

```
For commuters and Telegram users
who want quick entertainment without app store hassle,
eastsea.monster games are instant-play social mini games
that deliver fun in one tap.
Unlike traditional mobile games that require downloads and accounts,
our games play instantly in your browser or Telegram chat.
```

### Per-Game Template

```
For [specific persona subset]
who [specific situation],
{Game Name} is a [genre + platform qualifier]
that [core benefit of THIS game].
Unlike [closest competitor],
{Game Name} [THIS game's unique hook].
```

## Framework 5: Differentiation Layers

### Layer 1 — Portfolio-Level Differentiation
These apply to ALL our games:

| Differentiator | Proof | Messaging |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Zero installation | HTML5/WASM | "Play in 1 tap" |
| Cross-platform | Web standard | "Phone, tablet, desktop — same game" |
| Solo dev authenticity | It's true | "Made by one person who actually plays" |
| Rapid updates | Small team = fast | "You ask, I ship" |
| No data harvesting | Minimal permissions | "We don't need your contacts or location" |
| 30+ game library | Portfolio breadth | "Don't like this one? Try 29 others" |

### Layer 2 — Platform-Level Differentiation

| vs Traditional Mobile | vs Other Telegram Games | vs Web Portals |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| No download needed | Higher polish | Dev community & story |
| No app permissions | Consistent quality | Portfolio cross-promo |
| Play on any device | Rust/WASM performance | Update frequency |
| No account required | Not crypto-dependent | Direct player contact |

### Layer 3 — Game-Level Differentiation
Each game should have ONE unique thing:

```markdown
{Game Name}'s "Only We" Statement:

"Only {Game Name} lets you {unique action/experience} 
because {reason this is possible/special}."

Example:
"Only TilePop lets you challenge Telegram friends to real-time 
puzzle duels because it's built natively for Telegram Mini Apps."
```

## Framework 6: Competitive Response Playbook

### When a Competitor Launches Something Similar

```
1. ASSESS (1 day)
   - How similar is it really?
   - What's their reach/distribution?
   - What do they do better? Worse?

2. DIFFERENTIATE (1 week)
   - Double down on our unique hook
   - Ship the feature they don't have
   - Collect "why we're different" player quotes

3. COMMUNICATE (ongoing)
   - Update positioning if needed
   - Don't mention competitor by name
   - Focus on "why us" not "why not them"
```

### When We Enter a Crowded Genre

```
1. Find the "missing" quadrant in the competitive map
2. Build ONE feature that no competitor has
3. Position around that ONE thing
4. Let the portfolio ("30+ games by the same dev") be social proof
```

## Quick Reference: Positioning Don'ts

| Don't | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| "Best game ever" | Unbelievable, generic | "The fastest-loading puzzle game on Telegram" |
| "Like X but better" | Positions you as a copy | "A fresh take on [genre]" |
| "For everyone" | Positions you for no one | "Perfect for your commute" |
| "AAA quality" | Sets wrong expectations | "Polished indie craftsmanship" |
| "Revolutionary" | Eye-roll inducing | Show, don't tell (GIF > words) |
| Compare on features | Feature war = lose | Compare on experience |
