### 🎯 Actionable Items

#### ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
1. **OpenAI Shell + Skills API pattern study** — The inline base64 zip skill injection via Responses API is a powerful pattern. Study for potential cross-compatibility with our skill publishing workflow.
2. **planning-with-files skill evaluation** — "Manus" workflow pattern (persistent markdown files: task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md) addresses context window limits. Compare with our existing Brain/spec workflow. Potential absorption into SDD pipeline.
3. **Superpowers TDD workflow audit** — #1 ranked skill. Compare its Red-Green-Refactor enforcement and 4-phase debugging with our Self-Verification Loops.
4. **Security posture: Audit @kjaylee ClawHub skills** — With ongoing typosquat/impersonation attacks, verify no one has published lookalike skills under similar names.

#### 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY
5. **Context7 MCP server evaluation** — 35K+ stars, provides version-specific docs in-prompt. Could enhance our development workflow significantly.
6. **AntV Charts MCP** — 3K stars, chart generation server. Useful for game analytics dashboards or marketing reports.
7. **Stock/Finance MCP servers** — New finance data servers trending. Low priority for game dev but useful for daily digest enrichment.
8. **humanizer skill** — #10 on best-of list. Evaluate for blog/novel content pipeline to improve AI-generated text naturalness.

#### 🟡 LOW PRIORITY
9. **WordPress Agent Skills** — New guide published (NexGrowix). Not relevant to our stack but signals WordPress ecosystem adoption.
10. **Monitor Codex CLI + skills.sh integration** — ITECS published a cross-platform guide today. Track for distribution reach.

### 🔒 Security Status
- ✅ Zero-blind-install policy: ACTIVE
- ✅ Research → Audit → Rewrite pipeline: ACTIVE
- ⚠️ ClawHub typosquat attacks: ONGOING (Reddit reports Feb 12)
- ⚠️ 13.4% critical skills rate (Snyk ToxicSkills): UNCHANGED
- 🔴 Molt Road: ABSOLUTE BLOCK (confirmed by InfoStealers, ToxSec, TechManiacs)
