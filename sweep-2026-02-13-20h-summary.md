## 🔒 Security

- **Molt Road escalation:** toxsec.com published deep analysis (Feb 6) confirming stolen credentials, weaponized skills, and zero-day exploits traded on the platform. Multiple security firms now tracking.
- **ClawHub security posture:** Reddit thread (yesterday) recommends `github`, `agentmail`, `linear`, `playwright-mcp`, `obsidian-direct` — all popular installs. Supply chain risk persists.
- **Our policy (Research → Audit → Rewrite) remains the gold standard.** Zero blind installs.

## 🎯 Actionable Items

### ⭐ HIGH Priority
1. **Investigate `nblm` (magicseek)** — 4.9K trending installs, unknown function. Could be useful or risky.
2. **Evaluate Coinbase agentic-wallet-skills** — Agent commerce/payment infrastructure. x402 protocol for pay-per-use APIs. Potential monetization channel for game tools.
3. **Absorb `flutter-animations` patterns** — If Master ever considers Flutter for cross-platform game distribution, this skill architecture is worth studying.
4. **Marketing skills suite audit** — coreyhaines31's 17-skill marketing bundle covers our game launch needs (SEO audit, launch strategy, pricing, referral programs). Evaluate for game-marketing skill enhancement.

### 🟢 MEDIUM Priority
5. **Figma implement-design skill** — Design-to-code pipeline worth studying for UI workflow optimization.
6. **Expo/React Native skills** — React Native game distribution channel if needed (3 skills, 21K+ combined installs).
7. **obra/superpowers verification-before-completion** — Matches our Self-Verification Loops spec. Compare implementations.
8. **Railway deployment skills** — 4 skills (central-station, service, status, etc.) emerging for agent-managed deployments.

### 🟡 LOW Priority
9. **Monitor `baoyu-post-to-x` / `baoyu-danger-x-to-markdown`** — X/Twitter automation skills trending (806/745 installs/24h). Game marketing social media angle.
10. **Track AgentSkillsHub.dev** — Security-first marketplace positioning. Shopify/SEO automation focus.
11. **Vue skills ecosystem** — `vue-best-practices` + `vue-debug-guides` both 5K+. Not our stack but market signal.

## 📊 Ecosystem Health

- **Skills.sh:** Explosive growth (56K skills, 1M+ total installs). Vercel infrastructure solid.
