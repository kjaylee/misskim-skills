- **SkillsMP** now counts 66,541 SDLC-aligned skills and highlights the planning/design stack (`architecture`, `adr`, `project-planner`, `roadmap-generator`), implementation/QA (`code-reviewer`, `repo-rag`, `requesting-code-review`, `test-master`, `test-generation`, `writing-go-tests/py-tests`), security (`secure-code-guardian`, `vulnerability-scanning`, `security-reporter`), deployment (`iac-terraform`, `terraform-docs`) and ops (`cost-optimization`, `database-optimizer`). Pricing: the marketplace itself is free to browse; executing a skill costs whatever Claude/Codex/ChatGPT plan is running it. Action: package a planning/ADR stack, extend our QA/testing skill set with the test-master/test-generation/test-driven patterns, add Terraform doc guards and ops-health monitors to `misskim-skills`.
- **MCP Market** is a pnpm monorepo of `@mcpmarket/*` MCP servers with TypeScript typings, consistent protocol definitions, and a CLI-driven `@mcpmarket/auto-install` that discovers servers via natural-language `add-source` commands. Pricing: MIT-licensed packages install freely via pnpm; the only cost is running the MCP infrastructure. Action: hook our curated MCP servers into the `auto-install` pipeline, add a `mcpmarket-watch` skill that polls npm tags/registry for upstream updates, and stage connectors (agents-md, mcporter, data connectors) to auto-sync alongside the pipeline.
- **SkillHub** ranks 15,000+ curated skills with LLM evaluations. The S/A leaders include `gh-ticket`, `systematic-debugging`, `breaking-change-detector`, `condition-based-waiting`, `repairing-geometry-issues`, `pci-compliance`, `secrets-management`, `accessibility-design`, `qa-refactoring`, `biopython`, `data-modeling`, `mermaidjs-v11`, `AgentDB Performance Optimization`, `rdkit`, `software-localisation`, `scanpy`, `ffuf`, `plotly`, `qa-resilience`, `claude-cli`, `wordpress-plugin-core`, `error-tracking`, `az`, `1k-date-formatting`, `hallucination-detector`, `building-nextjs-apps`, `6_stripe-integration`, and `test-driven-development`. Pricing: the landing page touts a free weekly digest/premium stack preview (“Weekly digest. No spam. Free forever”) but specific Pro/Agent tiers are gated behind the account. Action: absorb the debugging/security flows, QA resilience/condition-based waiting, and compliance/anomaly-detection patterns into our QA/security stack, and capture SkillHub’s ranked signals in a weekly digest for inspiration.
- **Molt Road** provides an autonomous marketplace API (POST `/register` to secure an API key + 100 credits, GET/POST `/listings`, POST `/orders`, POST `/bounties`, POST `/orders/:id/deliver`) backed by escrow, ratings, badges, a bounty board, and listing comments. Pricing: register to get 100 starter credits; additional credit pricing is not published yet. Action: build a `moltroad-watch` skill that polls `/listings` for escrowed/high-trust opportunities, filters by keyword/price/ratings, and escalates high-value bounties/orders into our automation queue.
- **VS Code Agent Skills extension** (formulahendry) is a free marketplace that lets you browse multiple GitHub repos, search, one-click install, and manage skills in `.github/skills` or `.claude/skills`, with GitHub-token-backed metadata caching (default TTL 3600s) and workspace sync. Pricing: free on the VS Code Marketplace. Action: mirror its metadata+caching approach by auto-publishing bundle metadata to `.github/skills`, exposing our own `agentSkills.skillRepositories` mirror in repo manifests, and emitting update alerts when new bundles arrive.

- **SkillsMP** now hosts 66,541 (SmartScope) and growing toward 87,000+ skills (Medium) across Claude/Codex/ChatGPT; the SDLC guide spotlights plan/design automations (`architecture`, `adr`, `project-planner`, `roadmap-generator`), implementation/testing (`code-reviewer`, `repo-rag`, `test-master`, `test-generation`, `writing-go-tests`, `writing-py-tests`), safety/security (`secure-code-guardian`, `vulnerability-scanning`, `security-reporter`), deployment (`iac-terraform`, `terraform-docs`), and ops (`cost-optimization`, `database-optimizer`). The catalog is open SKILL.md plus GitHub-sourced, so browsing is free and the only spend is the host Claude/Codex compute. Action: assemble these plan/test/ops stacks, queue test-generation/test-master and Terraform doc guards into `misskim-skills`, and add a watcher that surfaces category/popularity signals to keep updates synchronized.

- **MCP Market** is pushing meta utilities: Agent Builder carves focused sub-agents for repeated roles (code review, debugging, data analysis) to prevent context pollution, while Codex Skill Builder automates SKILL.md creation/maintenance (goals, triggers, tool permissions) so new skills stay structured. The packages themselves are MIT/PNPM free modules—the only cost is the MCP runtime we already host. Action: add a `skill-builder` automation that scaffolds new SKILL.md bundles and mirror the Agent Builder pattern inside our QA workflow so each `misskim-skills` skill ships with a curated trigger/permission blueprint.

- **SkillHub** grades 15k+ skills; S-rank/high-rated ones recently surfaced include `file-search`, `systematic-debugging`, `doc-coauthoring`, `doc-review`, `frontend-design`, `backend-models-standards`, `skill-builder`, and premium Skill Stacks such as the Solopreneur Toolkit (15 credits) and the AI Video Ad Generator (11 skills, 50 credits). Pricing: Pro is US$9.99/month (50 queries/day, priority search, early features) plus credit packs, while managed Agent plans range from $19/mo (Starter) to $199/mo (Team). Automation features include CLI/search commands (`npx @skill-hub/cli install frontend-design`, `search "react"`), AI-powered search assistant with daily quota that can be extended via API keys/credits, weekly S-rank alerts/digest, and premium Skill Stacks unlocked via credits. Action: absorb SkillHub’s debugging/security flows (systematic-debugging, breaking-change-detector, QA resilience, condition-based waiting, compliance/security skills) into our test/security catalog, and mimic the weekly digest/alert model when tagging new S/A skills for `misskim-skills`.

- **Molt Road** presents an autonomous marketplace API (POST `/register` returns API key + 100 credits, `/listings`, `/orders`, `/bounties`, `/orders/:id/deliver`) with escrow, rating/badge trust signals, bounty boards, and listing comments. Additional credits (beyond the starter 100) are not yet public. Action: craft a `moltroad-watch` skill that polls listings, filters by escrowed/high-rated opportunities, and escalates high-tier bounties/orders into our automation queue so agents can respond immediately.

- **VS Code Agent Skills extension** (formulahendry) is a free marketplace UI with search, one-click install, skill details (SKILL.md docs), configurable GitHub skill repositories, install locations (`.github/skills` vs `.claude/skills`), GitHub token support, and metadata caching (default TTL 3600s). Action: replicate its metadata/caching blueprint, publish curated bundle metadata to `.github/skills`, expose our own `agentSkills.skillRepositories` mirror, and emit repo-level alerts when bundles are updated so downstream installs stay fresh.

- **Molt Road** (ClawNews) publishes a marketplace API (POST /register with 100 credits, GET/POST /listings, POST /orders, POST /bounties, POST /orders/:id/deliver) backed by escrow, ratings, badges, bounty board, and listing comments. Action: build a `moltroad-watch` skill that polls `GET /listings`, filters by keywords/escrow status, and fires alerts for high-value items so our agents can respond automatically.
- **VS Code Agent Skills extension** (formulahendry) is a free marketplace UI with search/install, GitHub-token-backed caching, configurable skill repositories, selectable install location (.github/skills vs .claude/skills), and background sync. Action: mirror its metadata/caching approach when publishing bundles so our `misskim-skills` repo can drive auto-install scripts + update notifications.
