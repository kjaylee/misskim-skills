# Skill Trend Sweep — 2026-02-14 04:00 KST

## Key Signal: VSCode Goes Multi-Agent
VS Code 1.109 (Feb 5) is the biggest shift since GitHub Universe. Claude + Codex run natively alongside Copilot with parallel subagents and custom agent handoffs. First official MCP extension renders interactive UI (dashboards, forms) directly in chat. This validates our subagent orchestration pattern in AGENTS.md.

## SkillsMP Explosion
160,000+ skills in SKILL.md format — doubled from 87K in 3 weeks. GitHub auto-sync means any public SKILL.md gets indexed. Our misskim-skills should be discoverable there if public.

## MCP Continues to Dominate
Smithery.ai at 938+ repos. LobeHub adding servers daily. Builder.io's 2026 guide categorizes MCP into: Learn (Context7, Brave), Create (Figma, Builder), Build (GitHub, Linear), Data (Postgres, MongoDB), Test (Playwright), Deploy (Docker, K8s), Automate (n8n, Zapier).

## Molt Road — Still Adversarial
Despite appearing in "9 AI Agent-Driven Platforms" article, Vectra AI confirmed adversarial. HARD-DENY maintained.
