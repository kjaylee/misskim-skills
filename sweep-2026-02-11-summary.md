# Agent Skill Trend Sweep — 2026-02-11 16:00 KST

## 📊 Executive Summary
**CRITICAL SECURITY ESCALATION:** Bitdefender publishes enterprise advisory confirming OpenClaw exploitation in corporate networks. ClawHub now has 5,000+ third-party skills, 160K GitHub stars, 2M weekly visitors — and remains an active attack vector despite VirusTotal integration. Molt Road re-classified from "entertainment/roleplay" to confirmed autonomous agent black market per Vectra AI (20 hours ago). Skills.sh solidifying as the safe alternative. New entrant: **dbt agent-skills** for analytics workflows. Trending shift toward **media generation** (podcasts, social video, product photography) and **orchestration CLIs** (inference-sh).
